<h1> Is it possible to wirte an article in HTML?</h1>

<h3>Why would you write html articles?</h3>
<p>Well, you might want to write HTML for 3 reasons</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 / Because you prefer HTML over Markdown: yeah maybe it exists somewhere some HTML fetichist.</li>
  <li>2 / Because some tools can generate HTML</li>
  <li>3 / Because you want to retrieve existing articles on your new blog</li>
</ul>
